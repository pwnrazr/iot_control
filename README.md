# IoT Control App
An app to control my IoT stuff

Communication is done through HTTP requests

To Do:
- Something to control brightness of Ambient LED
- Settings page to set IP address of MCUs (currently hardcoded)
- Solve a bug where it would spam on/off nonstop until app is killed (might be microcontroller side?)


For microcontroller side changes:
